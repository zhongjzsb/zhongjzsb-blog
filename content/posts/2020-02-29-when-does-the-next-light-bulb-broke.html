<p>Today our :bulb: bulb in the second floor went out. It looks like this:

<p>This is a special light so that we cannot buy a general bulb to replace the old one. The only option left to us is to buy a new whole light.
Jackie and I was discussing about how many lights we need to buy.</p>
<p>So first thing comes to my mind is that the lifetime of a bulb is exponetially distributed. It comes out so natural but Jackie asked me why it is the case? So I did some search and this <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2478820/exponential-bulbs">math stackexchange</a> has some explanation about this. I think the essential assumption is that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a used item has no better (or worse) life expectancy than a new one, then it is a candidate for an exponential lifetime model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since exponential distribution is memory-less. I guess it should be a good fit to that if we assume an random old bulb is as good as a new one.</p>
<p>Once we agreed on this exponential assumption. It linked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson Distribution wiki</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If for every <span class="math inline">\(t &gt; 0\)</span> the number of arrivals in the time interval <span class="math inline">\([0, t]\)</span> follows the Poisson distribution with mean <span class="math inline">\(\lambda t\)</span>, then the sequence of inter-arrival times are independent and identically distributed exponential random variables having mean <span class="math inline">\(1/\lambda\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, the bulb is installed in 2017 and the best estimate of this bulb is 3 years as we only have one sample. We will then expect the next light bulb will go out in 3 years.</p>
<p>We donâ€™t need to buy two lights if we think 3 years is long time. :smile:</p>
