We visited Len Ford Park along the Ontario lake yesterday. It's very small park. We did a 15-minute walk in the park and saw everything.

The good thing about the park is that it has a nice view of the lake. The specialty is that there's a narrow road towards the center of the lake with trees around.

The wind and waves from the lake were so heavy. Even the temperature was nice (around 7&deg;C). It was so cold around 7pm.

Here are the tree and trees.
