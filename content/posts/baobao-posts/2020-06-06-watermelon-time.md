The world inside my house is peaceful and quiet. But the world outside of my house is so crazy. Lots of big events happened in the past month.

- The relationship between US and China has been crashed into historical low. To transfer the angers from American people, Trump has been trying so hard to blame other people and countries.
- Street vendors (摆地摊) has been banned for years in China. To stimulate the economy, the government started to allow it again.
- The Black Lives Matter all over the world. It's definitely a great move not only for the black people but also for people with other color.
- Will Hainan replace Hong Kong as the next big free port? We will see.

My recent favorite poke belly with Korean kimchi & green pepper!
