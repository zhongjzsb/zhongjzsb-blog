I randomly browse my steam library today. Then a [ARTIFACT post](https://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791461919240/announcements/detail/1821083382556531528) shows up.

[![artifact][artifact]](https://steamcommunity.com/gid/103582791461919240/announcements/detail/1821083382556531528)

OMG, I was missing Artifact so much!

Come on. Give me some hopes.
