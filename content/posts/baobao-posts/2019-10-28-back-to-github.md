## Something about github:

if you want to delete commit from github, here are the steps you want to use ([Reference website](https://gist.github.com/CrookedNumber/8964442#targetText=To%20remove%20the%20last%20commit,to%20remove%20even%20more%20commits)):

```git
git reset --hard \<commit-id\>
git push origin -f
```
