I keep thinking the poet [*Norther Winslow*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319061/characters/nm0000114) in the small town in the movie [Big-Fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Fish), who wrote the following amazing poem in 12 years.

{{< hint info >}}
*The grass so green.*

*Skies so blue.*

*Spectre is really great!*
{{< /hint >}}

And then he told us that

> This is why you don't show work in progress.

If you keep learning the basics of abc and the ABC of xyz, you are a Spectre poet! :laughing:
