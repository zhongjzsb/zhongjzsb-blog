      <description>从3月9号周一开始在家上班到今天，已经整整一个月。已经渐渐熟悉了在家工作的节奏。 偶然间觉得未来肯定会：
 越来越多的公司实行在家上班的政策，即使疫情过去。 会有很多金融书籍来诉说这段暴跌和暴涨的日子。  It has been one month since I started to work from home. I feel like
 There will be more company apply work-from-home policy even after the virus. There will be lots of books talking about the extreme volatile financial market in 2020.  </description>

      <description>I keep thinking about the poet Norther Winslow in the small town called Spectre in the movie Big-Fish, who wrote the following amazing poem in 12 years.
The grass so green.
Skies so blue.
Spectre is really great!
But come on, there&amp;rsquo;re only three lines! Then he complained
 This is why you don&amp;rsquo;t show work in progress.
 If you keep learning the basics of abc and the ABC of xyz, you are a Spectre poet!</description>

      <title>Len Ford Park</title>

      <description>We visited Len Ford Park along the Ontario lake yesterday. It&amp;rsquo;s very small park. We did a 15-minute walk in the park and saw everything.
The good thing about the park is that it has a nice view of the lake. The specialty is that there&amp;rsquo;s a narrow road towards the center of the lake with trees around.
The wind and waves from the lake were so heavy. Even the temperature was nice (around 7°C).</description>

$$ Current + Recovered + Death = Confirmed $$

      <title>When Will the Next Light Bulb Go Out?</title>
      <link>https://zhongjzsb.com/posts/baobao-posts/light-bulb-go-out/</link>

      <description>Today our 💡 bulb in the second floor went out. It looks like this:
![special bulb](/images/special-bulb-york-mills.jpg){width=400px height=300px} --This is a special light so that we cannot buy a general bulb to replace the old one. The only option left to us is to buy a new whole light. Jackie and I was discussing about how many lights we need to buy.
So first thing comes to my mind is that the lifetime of a bulb is exponentially distributed.</description>
