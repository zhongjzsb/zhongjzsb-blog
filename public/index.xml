      <description>I keep thinking about the poet Norther Winslow in the small town called Spectre in the movie Big-Fish, who wrote the following amazing poem in 12 years.
The grass so green.
Skies so blue.
Spectre is really great!
But come on, there&amp;rsquo;re only three lines! Then he explained
 This is why you don&amp;rsquo;t show work in progress.
 If you keep learning the basics of abc and the ABC of xyz, you are a Spectre poet!</description>

      <description>We visit Len Ford Park yesterday. A very small park, about 100 meters long along with the Ontario lake.
A road with tree around sits towards the center of the lake.

      <title>When Will the Next Light Bulb Go Out?</title>
      <link>https://zhongjzsb.com/posts/baobao-posts/light-bulb-go-out/</link>

      <description>Today our ðŸ’¡ bulb in the second floor went out. It looks like this:
![special bulb](/images/special-bulb-york-mills.jpg){width=400px height=300px} --This is a special light so that we cannot buy a general bulb to replace the old one. The only option left to us is to buy a new whole light. Jackie and I was discussing about how many lights we need to buy.
So first thing comes to my mind is that the lifetime of a bulb is exponentially distributed.</description>
