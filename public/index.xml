      <title>When Will the Next Light Bulb Go Out?</title>
      <link>https://zhongjzsb.com/posts/baobao-posts/light-bulb-go-out/</link>

![special bulb](/images/special-bulb-york-mills.jpg){width=400px height=300px} --This is a special light so that we cannot buy a general bulb to replace the old one. The only option left to us is to buy a new whole light. Jackie and I was discussing about how many lights we need to buy.
So first thing comes to my mind is that the lifetime of a bulb is exponentially distributed.</description>
