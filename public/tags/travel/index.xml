      <description>We visited Len Ford Park along the Ontario lake yesterday. It&amp;rsquo;s very small park. We did a 15-minute walk in the park and saw everything.
The good thing about the park is that it has a nice view of the lake. The specialty is that there&amp;rsquo;s a narrow road towards the center of the lake with trees around.
The wind and waves from the lake were so heavy. Even the temperature was nice (around 7Â°C).</description>
